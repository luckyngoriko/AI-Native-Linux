//! Autonomous self-healing module inspired by MINIX process manager / reincarnation server.
//!
//! Unlike operator-driven recovery, the self-healing daemon runs autonomously:
//! it monitors component health, decides restart/isolate/failover actions,
//! executes them within recovery-mode scope, and emits immutable evidence for
//! every action taken.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! SelfHealingDriver trait          ← abstract driver surface
//!   └── InMemorySelfHealingDriver   ← in-process impl with health registry
//!
//! SelfHealingPolicy                ← declarative policy: which components, limits, scopes
//! RestartPolicy                    ← per-component: immediate/backoff/max-retries
//! ComponentHealthState             ← observed state: Healthy/Degraded/Failed/Unknown
//! HealAction                       ← decided autonomous action + required scope grant
//! ```
//!
//! ## Constitutional guarantees
//!
//! - INV-001 (no L5 in recovery): self-healing only mutates L1–L4 infrastructure.
//! - INV-012 (recovery required): every mutation happens inside an active recovery session.
//! - INV-005 (evidence append-only): each heal action produces a FOREVER receipt.
//! - The subject `_system:service:self-healing` holds pre-authorized scoped grants; no
//!   operator approval is needed at decision time (grants were pre-approved during boot).
